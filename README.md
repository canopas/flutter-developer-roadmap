Flutter Developer Roadmap 2023 is a learning path to understand flutter development.

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is an SDK(Software Development Kit) developed by google that allows developer to build native cross-platform apps with just one programming langauage-Dart. From single codebase, it creates native app for ios, Android and web, that can be published to the stores later.
